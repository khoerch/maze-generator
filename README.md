# maze-generator
Create mazes using Depth First Search algorithm. Enter values in the input to change the size, complexity, or look of the maze. This project was an attempt to combine straight-forward algorithms with an immediate visual representation. Credit for the inspiration for this project is below. I adapted their use of the Depth First Search algorithm from an orthogonal maze to a theta maze.
